Below is a sample **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for building a landing page for your SaaS using Shadcn, React, and the listed 21st.dev components. Each step is broken down so that even an AI Agent could follow it programmatically.

---

## 1. **Overview**

### 1.1 **Purpose** 
This landing page is intended to showcase the core value proposition of your upcoming SaaS. It should include:
- A visually appealing **Heading (Navbar)**
- An engaging **Hero Section**
- A concise **Feature Section**
- A clear **Pricing Section**
- A final **Footer** to wrap up the page

By using Shadcn and the 21st.dev components, we will ensure a polished, modern, and cohesive UI.

### 1.2 **Scope**
This PRD covers:
- Setting up a new React project (or using an existing one).
- Installing the necessary dependencies (Shadcn, 21st.dev components).
- Integrating the five listed components in the correct order on a single page.
- Basic configuration and customization of those components to reflect your SaaS branding and messaging.

---

## 2. **Requirements**

1. **Technology Stack**:
   - **React** (Latest version)
   - **Tailwind CSS** (if not already integrated by Shadcn tooling)
   - **Node.js** >= 14
   - **Shadcn** CLI (for adding components)
   
2. **Components from 21st.dev** (via Shadcn CLI):
   1. [Heading Navbar](https://21st.dev/r/ayushmxxn/tubelight-navbar)
   2. [Animated Hero](https://21st.dev/r/serafimcloud/animated-hero)
   3. [Feature Section with Hover Effects](https://21st.dev/r/aceternity/feature-section-with-hover-effects)
   4. [Pricing Section](https://21st.dev/r/aymanch-03/pricing-section)
   5. [Footer Section](https://21st.dev/r/arihantcodes/footer-section)

3. **Design & Branding**:
   - Cohesive color palette (ensure all components share the same primary, secondary, and accent colors).
   - Proper typography (fonts and sizes consistent with your brand guidelines).
   - Responsive layout (works on mobile, tablet, and desktop).

---

## 3. **Implementation Steps**

### 3.1 **Project Setup**

**Step 1**: Create a New React App or Use an Existing One
- **If creating a new React app**:  
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-saas-landing
  cd my-saas-landing
  ```
- **If using an existing React app**:  
  - Navigate to the project root:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your-existing-react-project
    ```

**Step 2**: Ensure Node.js is installed and up-to-date
- Confirm version:
  ```bash
  node -v
  ```
  If the version is below 14, update Node.js before proceeding.

### 3.2 **Install Shadcn CLI**

**Step 3**: Install Shadcn if not already installed
- From your project root, install the Shadcn CLI globally or locally.
  ```bash
  npm install shadcn@latest --save-dev
  ```
  > Or globally:
  > ```bash
  > npm install -g shadcn@latest
  > ```

**Step 4**: Initialize Shadcn
- Configure the CLI within your project (if Shadcn demands an init command):
  ```bash
  npx shadcn init
  ```
  - Follow the prompts to set up your configuration (or accept defaults).

### 3.3 **Add 21st.dev Components**

We have five components to add in the given order. Ensure that each command is run in your project root directory.

1. **Heading (Navbar)**  
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/ayushmxxn/tubelight-navbar"
   ```
   - This will create or update a component folder (e.g., `components/navbar/` or similar).
   - Follow any prompts related to name collisions or overwriting existing files.

2. **Hero Section**  
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/serafimcloud/animated-hero"
   ```
   - Creates a new hero section component (e.g., `components/hero/`).

3. **Feature Section**  
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/aceternity/feature-section-with-hover-effects"
   ```
   - Creates a new features component (e.g., `components/features/`).

4. **Pricing Section**  
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/aymanch-03/pricing-section"
   ```
   - Creates a pricing component (e.g., `components/pricing/`).

5. **Footer**  
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/arihantcodes/footer-section"
   ```
   - Creates a footer component (e.g., `components/footer/`).

**Step 5**: Verify Installation
- Inspect the `components/` directory to confirm that all five sections appear.
- Ensure that each new folder or file structure corresponds to the commands executed.

### 3.4 **Integrate Components Into the Landing Page**

**Step 6**: Create a new page or use an existing `App.js` or `index.js`
- For clarity, create a dedicated page for the landing experience, e.g., `src/pages/LandingPage.js` (if you use a routing system like React Router) or simply embed everything into `App.js`.

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import Navbar from '../components/tubelight-navbar';  // Example path
  import Hero from '../components/animated-hero';       // Example path
  import Features from '../components/feature-section-with-hover-effects';
  import Pricing from '../components/pricing-section';
  import Footer from '../components/footer-section';

  const LandingPage = () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <Navbar />
        <Hero />
        <Features />
        <Pricing />
        <Footer />
      </div>
    );
  };

  export default LandingPage;
  ```

**Step 7**: Adjust Layout & Wrapper (Optional)
- If needed, wrap sections in a parent container to set max-width or adjust spacing:
  ```css
  .container {
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 1rem;
  }
  ```
  or  
  ```jsx
  <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
    <Navbar />
    <Hero />
    <Features />
    <Pricing />
    <Footer />
  </div>
  ```

### 3.5 **Customize Component Props & Styles**

**Step 8**: Open each generated component in the `components/` folder.  
- Update texts, images, or placeholders to match your SaaS branding.
- Modify color classes, Tailwind utility classes, or dynamic props as needed.
- For example, in the **Hero** component, you might see placeholders like `Your Product Name` or `CTA Button Text`. Replace these with your SaaS messaging.

### 3.6 **Ensure Responsiveness & Accessibility**

**Step 9**: Use your browser’s dev tools to simulate mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Verify that the navbar collapses or adjusts for mobile.
- Confirm that text is legible at smaller sizes.
- Make sure the hero animation is not too heavy on mobile.

**Step 10**: Test for basic accessibility
- Check all images, if any, for `alt` attributes.
- Ensure color contrast meets recommended guidelines (WCAG AA at minimum).
- Confirm all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard navigation.

### 3.7 **Review & Finalize**

**Step 11**: Code Review & QA
- Perform a final pass to ensure there are no console errors in the browser.
- Check for any styling or spacing inconsistencies.



  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run serve
  ```
  or the appropriate commands for your chosen hosting provider.

## 5. **Additional Notes**

- **Customization**: You can easily tweak each section’s styling using Tailwind utility classes, as the 21st.dev components are generally Tailwind-based.
- **Animations**: The “Animated Hero” and “Feature Hover” might have transitions/animations; ensure they don’t negatively impact performance.
- **Future Enhancements**:  
  - Add a contact form or email capture (optional).
  - Integrate analytics to track user engagement.
  - Include more robust routing for additional content pages if needed.

### Final Remark
By following these steps precisely, **even an AI Agent** can automate the process: from running Shadcn commands to placing and customizing the components. This ensures a swift and consistent implementation for your SaaS landing page.
